# Data Challenge - Kaggle - Summary Source Prediction

The objective of this project was to solve a binary classification problem using text data. The dataset represents documents written by humans and their summaries. Each summary is labeled positively (1) if it was written by a
human or negatively (0) if it was generated by a machine. In the report, we explain how we processed the data, how we extracted
features from the data and finally the architecture of our best model (RoBERTa).
